    <h1>Pasta Sauce</h1>
   <img src="../Pics/Pasta.jpeg" alt="">
   <h3>This vegetarian spaghetti sauce is a yummy combination of collard greens, artichoke hearts, garbanzo beans, and more. I came up with this one night while trying to figure out how to get my 18-month old son to eat healthy greens. He absolutely loved it! Serve over whole wheat pasta with Parmesan cheese.

    <h3>This Hasselback potatoes recipe makes seasoned potatoes crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. This Swedish dish takes its name from Hasselbacken, the Stockholm restaurant where it was first served.
    </h3>
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (8 ounce) baking potatoes</li> 
        <li> 2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li> salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons finely grated fresh Romano cheese</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon seasoned dry bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

    </li>
    <li> Peel potatoes and place in a bowl of cold water to prevent browning</li>.
    <li> One at a time, dry potatoes and place in a large wooden or metal serving spoon. Using a sharp knife, slice potato crosswise at 1/8-inch intervals, cutting until the knife touches the spoon, being careful not to cut all the way through so the potato stays intact.</li>
    <li> Arrange potatoes cut-side up in a shallow baking dish or small roasting pan. Drizzle with 1/2 of the melted butter, then season with salt and pepper.</li>

   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
    <li>1 cup carrot matchsticks</li>
    <li>1 cup zucchini matchsticks</li>
    <li>½ (14 ounce) can bean sprouts, drained</li>
    <li> ounces canned bamboo shoots, drained</li>
    <li>1 (4.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained</li> 
    <li>⅛ teaspoon salt to taste</li>
    <li>2 cups cooked and cooled rice</li>
    <li>⅓ cup sliced green onions</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>3 teaspoons sweet red chili sauce, or to taste</li>  
</ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir carrot and zucchini in the hot oil until vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, and mushrooms. Cook and stir until carrots are tender, about 5 more minutes. Season to taste with salt and set vegetables aside.</li>
    <li>Stir cooked rice, green onions, soy sauce, and black pepper in the same skillet until the rice is hot. In a separate skillet over medium heat, melt butter and gently fry eggs, turning once, until the yolks are still slightly runny but the egg whites are firm, about 3 minutes per egg.</li>
    <li>To serve, divide hot cooked rice mixture between 3 serving bowls and top each bowl with 1/3 of the vegetable mixture and a fried egg. Serve sweet red chili sauce on the side for mixing into bibimbap.</li>
